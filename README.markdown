# Duplicate Field

* Version: 1.0
* Author: Phill Gray
* Build Date: 2017-11-0
* Requirements: Symphony CMS 2.7

Easily duplicate a field from within the Section Manager.

## Installation

- Upload the 'duplicatefield' folder to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
- Enable it by selecting "Duplicate Field", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

## Usage

Existing fields from within the Section Manager will have a link added to them, which will duplicate the field when clicked. All settings will be copied, including the handle. **Note that the handle will need to be changed to prevent an error when saving the section.**

Only existing fields can be duplicated, so create your initial field first, save the section, then duplicate.
